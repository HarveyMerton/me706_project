MECHENG 706 Project 1
Group 18: Harvey Merton, Peter Mitchell, Vincent Wong and Hamish Giles

- Calibration: 
    - Calibration - For finding sensor functions (converts sensor readings to distances).
    - ReadSensors - For reading the sensor results from calibrated functions (tests calibration).

- Running code: 
    - RobotBaseCodes - Codes required to run the robot. 
    - Sensor.zip - Library that encapsulates all functions required to read all sensor types. This library is referenced in the code. 
    - Sensor_withInheritance.zip - Library that includes multiple classes. Essentially a divided version of Sensor.zip to make the most of the OOP property of inheritance. This is the class that is discussed in the report (to be implemented into the code in P2).
