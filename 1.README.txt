MECHENG 706 Project 1
Group 18: Harvey Merton, Peter Mitchell, Vincent Wong and Hamish Giles

- Calibration: 
    - Calibration - For finding sensor functions (converts sensor readings to distances).
    - ReadSensors - For reading the sensor results from calibrated functions (tests calibration).

- Running code: 
    - RobotBaseCodes - Codes required to run the robot. 
    - Sensor.zip - Class that encapsulates all functions required to read all sensor types. 
	This library must be included before running the code: Arduino>Sketch>Include 			library>Add .ZIP library.
